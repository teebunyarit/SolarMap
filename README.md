# Improving cloud attenuation model for ground irradiance estimation across Thailand using cloud images from Himawari satellite

This repository is created for version control of our senior project in `2102499: Electrical Engineering Project` during of August 2022 - May 2023.

I and Nuttamon had worked on this project with guidance from Associate Professor Jitkomut Songsiri in my senior year.This project is an extension of the Thailand Solar Map by CUEE project and aims to improve the efficiency of the cloud attenuation model.
