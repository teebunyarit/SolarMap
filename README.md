# Improving cloud attenuation model for ground irradiance estimation across Thailand using cloud images from Himawari satellite

This repository is created for version control of our senior project in `2102499: Electrical Engineering Project` during of August 2022 - May 2023.

I and Nuttamon had worked on this project with guidance from Associate Professor Jitkomut Songsiri in my senior year.This project is an extension of the Thailand Solar Map by CUEE project and aims to improve the efficiency of the cloud attenuation model.The proposed model uses cloud images from the Himawari-8 satellite and physical data for each area. This project develops three types of models: regression models, tree-based models, and deep learning models. The overall process of our project are shown below.
